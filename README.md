In each bundle of 3 rows or columns, check if number X is in there twice
If so, check the square without the number to see if X can be deduced.

Deduce possible small numbers for each cell
Check each number in each row/col/square to see if there is only one possible place for the number

I there are identical pairs of possibles in each row/col/square eliminate these from possibles in other cells
